## Objective
To analyze survival patterns in the Titanic dataset and understand how passenger class and gender influenced survival outcomes.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- Rows: ~891
- Features used: Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age

## Key Insights
- Survival rates vary drastically when normalized by population size.
- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males.
- First-class passengers had a survival advantage over lower classes.
- Raw counts can be misleading without percentage-based analysis.

## Bias & Limitations
- Class distributions were uneven, requiring normalization.
- Age data contained missing values.
- This analysis is descriptive, not predictive.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
